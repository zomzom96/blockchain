Building a blockchain for practicing purposes. 

# Roadmap
* code the core blockchain.
* Build an API around the blockchain.
* Create a dynamic peer-to-peer server for multiple contributors.

* Create a transaction system that will serve as a cryptocurrency
* Using NodeJS as core langauge for this project

# Disributed Ledger: Multiple nodes connect through the core blockchain network. Each of the nodes gets a copy of the ledger. This idea of the blockchain being disributed eliminates the vulnerabilities that reside in using a centralized authority model (Banks) to keeo track of that ledger. That means there are no single points of failure for blockchain backed cryptocurrencies and/or systems.
